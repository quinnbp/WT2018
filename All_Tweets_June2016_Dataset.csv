5.65E+17,verified accounts have features that other accounts do not. not sure what kind of overhead increasing that # would have.,0
5.65E+17,"however, twitter clients and web are supposed to have the same tools/exp. that&#39;s why devpolicy doesn&#39;t really encourage 3rd party clients.",0

5.65E+17,@eDRoaCH @orvtech this isn&#39;t de-anonymizing. the phone # wouldn&#39;t necessarily be stored. no names would be required.,0
5.65E+17,@tomdcc it&#39;s very easy to change your GV #.,0
5.65E+17,it is really not at all surprising to me that wadhwa and jason are both promoting a solution that removes pseudonymity.,0

5.65E+17,"@tomdcc oh god that sounds like a horrible idea. privacy problems. also, twitter likely wouldn&#39;t be storing the number. that would be bad.",0

5.65E+17,@Spacekatgal yeahhhh. they were operating a loss until facebook bought them. fbook didn&#39;t buy them to make money off the service.,0
5.65E+17,@Spacekatgal it was to get the userbase. and we all know how fbook loves to do social experiments with data.,0
5.65E+17,@Spacekatgal twitter allows 13 yr olds. 13 yr olds don&#39;t generally have bank accts. *lots* of people don&#39;t have bank accts/work in cash.,0

5.65E+17,@Spacekatgal 80% of his points are bullshit taken from white cis male standpoint. no harassment on fbook? pft. providing ID/addy? NOPE.,0
5.65E+17,@Spacekatgal the client/web experience being similar are key. i don&#39;t know if twitter client has the additional controls verified accts have,0

5.72E+17,Watching other BSD devs tell roguestar he&#39;s wrong and it is delicious.,0

5.72E+17,Watching GamerGate mock women that are concerned about appearing at GDC given the threats they&#39;ve been inundated w/over the past 6 months.,0
5.72E+17,Perpetuating a culture where abuse is tolerated and targets of abuse are mocked for speaking out against their abusers.,0

5.73E+17,"@Jason_Gio meh. :P thanks for the heads up, but not too concerned about another angry dude on twitter.",0
5.73E+17,@Jason_Gio this is the same dude that thinks that not being allowed to publish an article to a site he doesn&#39;t own is silencing,0
